# TASK-1_ELEVATELAB_INTERN
Today, I worked on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. I handled missing values in columns like Age and Embarked, removed irrelevant features like Cabin, and encoded categorical variables such as Sex and Embarked. I also applied standard scaling to numerical features (Age, Fare) and detected outliers using the IQR method, removing them to improve data quality. Finally, I exported the cleaned dataset to Excel for further use in machine learning tasks.
